# M4 — Dual-Mode LOD & Interaction

**Goal:** the three-tier zoom experience becomes real: an orthographic L0 globe with density
rendering, hysteresis-gated L0↔L1↔L2 tier switching, an animated globe↔Mercator camera
transition, tier-gated trails/labels, the perceptual altitude ramp, and emergency squawk styling.
Exit criteria: [../docs/11_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md](../docs/11_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md) §M4.
Constraining docs: 01 (§Projection, §LOD budgets), the
[high-fidelity-flight-visualization skill](../.claude/skills/high-fidelity-flight-visualization/SKILL.md)
(LOD tier table, glyph/trail/label tier rules, Oklab altitude ramp — read before any renderer or
`core::camera` work), 04 (rule 6.1 — squawk display stays passive-only, no correlation/export),
13 (§L1/L0 + transitions, §Selection & overlays — both required at this gate).

## Known cross-milestone inheritance (read before 4.1)

M2's gate (2.10) and M3's gate (3.6) both explicitly deferred true LOD tier switching to this
milestone: the renderer currently draws everything at one fixed L2-style tier, and
`crates/core/src/camera.rs` is documented as "the *regional* Web Mercator camera only... there is
no global/orthographic view yet." M3's `Store::airports_in_bbox(bbox, min_size)` query-side
filtering already exists and is ready to be driven by whatever tier signal 4.1 produces — no
store-side work is expected here.

Two more open items feed into this milestone rather than being new discoveries:
- The M3 gate (3.6) found "emergency squawk styling" unimplemented and unscoped anywhere in
  `core::contracts`/`ingest`/`render`, flagged for the owner to schedule. Docs/13 §Selection &
  overlays lists it as "required at M3/M4," so it's scoped into this plan as 4.6 rather than
  left open again.
- `crates/render/src/color.rs`'s own comment (lines 84–88) already flags that the *perceptual*
  Oklab-interpolated altitude ramp — as opposed to the six flat per-bucket tints M2 shipped —
  "lands in M4." Scoped as 4.5.
- The carried renderer blocker (whole-world trails exceed wgpu's 256 MiB buffer, reproduced live
  during M3) is expected to be resolved as a *consequence* of 4.4's tier-gating (trails are L2-only
  per the skill, so an L0/L1 whole-world view never asks the trail buffer to hold planet-scale
  data) — 4.4 must verify this rather than assume it, and reopen the blocker explicitly if gating
  alone doesn't fix it (e.g. a fast zoom-out while a large L2 trail buffer is still live).

## Checklist

- [x] 4.1 LOD tier state with hysteresis (`core`): `LodTier` enum (`Global`/`Continental`/
      `Regional`) and `next_tier(previous, viewport_span_km)` state machine in new
      `crates/core/src/lod.rs`; `Camera::viewport_span_km()` added alongside `viewport_bbox` as
      the km-span source (a direct `width_px * meters_per_pixel` reading, not bbox-derived, so it
      stays representative when panned past the world edge or framing a pole). Asymmetric
      thresholds (3,300/3,000 km, 330/300 km) as the hysteresis band, each tier only exiting
      toward the threshold it can be re-entered from — one call resolves a fast multi-tier zoom
      directly, no stepping required. Acceptance met: unit tests dither ±5% around all four
      thresholds from each adjacent starting tier and settle without flipping; genuine-crossing
      tests both directions; workspace-isolated `cargo check`/`test`/`clippy --all-targets`/`fmt`
      on `look-above-core` all clean (31 tests passing, no new lints).
- [x] 4.2 Orthographic globe camera (`core`): `orthographic_forward`/`orthographic_inverse` added
      to `crates/core/src/geo.rs` (new `UnitDiskXy` unit-disk position type alongside
      `MercatorXy`), plus a new `GlobeCamera` in `crates/core/src/globe_camera.rs` mirroring
      `Camera`'s "no wgpu, no matrices, no winit" scoping: `rotate_by_pixels` (immediate, pixel-
      to-radian-linearized drag, sign convention matching `pan_by_pixels`) and `zoom_by_notches` +
      `update` (eased `radius_px`, cursor-anchored via a per-frame first-order correction toward
      the anchor's disk position — documented as a linear approximation, exact only near screen
      center; off-globe cursor clicks fall back to center-anchored scaling). No renderer wiring
      yet. Acceptance met: combinatorial-grid property tests (7 latitudes × 9 longitudes,
      including both poles and the antimeridian, for both `center` and `point`) confirm every
      visible-hemisphere projection lands inside the unit disk, every far-hemisphere point is
      excluded, and no NaN/Infinity is produced anywhere in the grid for forward or inverse;
      workspace-isolated `cargo check`/`test`/`clippy --all-targets`/`fmt` on `look-above-core`
      all clean (168 tests passing, no new lints).
- [x] 4.3 Globe↔Mercator transition + L0 density layer (`render`, `app`): `app::window::App` gained
      a `GlobeCamera` alongside the Mercator `Camera`, an `LodTier` recomputed every frame from
      `Camera::viewport_span_km()`, and an eased `mode_blend` (owner confirmed full-spherical-basemap
      scope via AskUserQuestion, not a placeholder disk) — `ease_mode_blend` mirrors `Camera`/
      `GlobeCamera`'s own exponential-ease-toward-target shape, converging within docs/13's 500 ms
      ceiling, retargetable (interruptible) for free. Both cameras receive every drag/wheel/resize
      input unconditionally (deliberate — see the field doc on `App::globe_camera`). `render` gained
      a real spherical basemap (`basemap::tessellate_globe`, `GlobeBasemapLayer`, per-vertex
      orthographic projection in `globe_basemap.wgsl` with a per-fragment `cos_c` discard for clean
      horizon clipping) and an additively-blended L0 density-dot layer (`density.rs`,
      `density.wgsl`) fed by the same `RenderFeed.aircraft` the glyph layer reads, culled to the
      near hemisphere via `core::geo::orthographic_forward`. Aircraft glyphs/trails/labels are
      deliberately *not* gated here — that's 4.4's job. Acceptance met via live-app visual pass
      (real OpenSky traffic, ~7,000 aircraft): globe renders as a correctly clipped hemisphere,
      density dots plausibly track real traffic contrast (Europe/Middle East/India denser than open
      ocean), flat Mercator map fades out under the globe with no leftover corners. One real bug
      found and fixed during that pass (see DECISION_LOG) and one gap knowingly carried to 4.4 (see
      Now section) — both owner-confirmed, not silently resolved.
- [ ] 4.4 Tier-gated rendering + cross-fade (`render`): gate `TrailLayer`/`LabelLayer` to
      `Regional` only and glyph vs. density-dot drawing to the correct tier per the skill's table;
      cross-fade opacity over 250 ms at tier boundaries so nothing pops. Verify (not assume) that
      this resolves the carried whole-world-trails-vs-256-MiB-buffer blocker from M2/M3 by
      exercising a fast global-to-runway-and-back zoom during manual verification; if a residual
      panic path remains (e.g. mid-transition), record it as a reopened blocker rather than
      silently re-carrying it. Acceptance: docs/13 §L1/L0 lines 1, 4, 5 (continuous zoom
      cross-fade; L0 density honesty; 8,000+ aircraft global at p95 < 16.6 ms via frame-stats
      overlay).
- [ ] 4.5 Perceptual altitude ramp (`render`): replace `color.rs`'s six flat per-bucket tints with
      Oklab interpolation between the same six stops, continuous by altitude value rather than
      discrete bucket (the comment at `color.rs:84-88` already scopes this). Acceptance: docs/13
      accessibility line — ramp ordering survives a deuteranopia simulation; existing
      `altitude_bucket_tint*` unit tests updated to check interpolated continuity, not just the
      six discrete stops.
- [ ] 4.6 Emergency squawk plumbing + styling (`ingest`, `core`, `render`): surface the squawk
      code already present in the raw ADS-B feed JSON (confirmed unused past ingest — see
      `crates/ingest/src/opensky/states.rs` and the adsblol/airplaneslive fixtures) through
      `ingest::normalize` into `core::contracts::StateVector`, and a pulsing red ring (1 Hz) in
      `render::aircraft`/`aircraft.wgsl` for 7500/7600/7700 per the skill's glyph spec. Passive
      display only — no notification, alert, export, or any new correlation path (privacy rule
      6.1); anonymous (LADD/PIA) aircraft keep rule 2.2's existing no-identity treatment
      regardless of squawk. Acceptance: docs/13 §Selection & overlays squawk line; a unit test
      confirming no new outbound call or persisted record is triggered by a squawk value alone.
- [ ] 4.7 Gate: full docs/13 visual QA checklist pass (not just the L2-core subset — §L1/L0 +
      transitions and §Selection & overlays in full), frame-stats evidence for the 8k+ global
      p95 < 16.6 ms line, docs/11 §M4's five acceptance lines all evidenced, human review.
