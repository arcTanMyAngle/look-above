# Decision Log

Append-only. One dated entry per non-trivial decision; architecture-shaping decisions also
get an ADR in [../docs/02_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_TEMPLATE.md](../docs/02_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_TEMPLATE.md).
Format: `date — decision — rationale — (ADR-ref if any)`.

## 2026-07-14 — Project inception decisions (owner Q&A)

- **Language: Rust** over C++ — rayon/wgpu/cargo path is fastest to a safe multithreaded
  native app. (ADR-001)
- **CPU for data, GPU for pixels** — all simulation/geo-math/indexing CPU-parallel; wgpu only
  rasterizes a prepared instance buffer. This is the project's stated parallel-computing goal.
  (ADR-002)
- **wgpu + winit, WGSL** — modern portable graphics on Windows (DX12/Vulkan). (ADR-003)
- **SQLite via rusqlite (bundled)** — zero-admin persistence for enrichment + history. (ADR-004)
- **tokio for I/O only; rayon for compute; crossbeam channels between stages** — no async
  outside `ingest`. (ADR-005)
- **Dual view modes (global + regional) with LOD tiers and hysteresis** — owner chose "both
  modes" explicitly; spec in docs/01.
- **Free data only; OpenSky as primary** (free account, OAuth2, 4k credits/day) with
  airplanes.live / adsb.lol as no-key fallbacks — owner accepts a free signup, pays nothing.
  Allowlist is exhaustive; scraping FR24/FlightAware/ADSBx prohibited (docs/04 §1).
- **Privacy rules adopted as binding** (docs/04): LADD/PIA respected, no re-identification,
  no tail-watching features, history local + capped.
- **Docs-first workflow with milestone gates** — one checklist item per AI session, handoff
  via plans/CURRENT_STATUS.md; model-to-task mapping in docs/12.
- **GitHub: push to `arcTanMyAngle/look-above`** — private by default until owner says otherwise.

## 2026-07-15 — M0 item 0.1 (workspace skeleton)

- **Toolchain pinned to 1.96.0** in `rust-toolchain.toml` (exact stable version, not the
  `stable` channel) — reproducible builds across machines/CI; bumps are deliberate and logged.
  (ADR-001)
- **Clippy lint set** (root `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.lints]`, inherited by all crates via
  `[lints] workspace = true`): `clippy::all` + `clippy::pedantic` at warn (CI runs
  `-D warnings`, so effectively deny); `clippy::unwrap_used = warn` to enforce the
  "no unwrap outside tests" rule. Allowed pedantic exceptions: `module_name_repetitions`,
  `must_use_candidate`, `missing_errors_doc`, `missing_panics_doc`, `float_cmp` — noise
  outweighs value for this codebase. Also `unsafe_code = warn` and
  `missing_debug_implementations = warn` at the rustc level.
- **Crate/package naming:** packages `look-above-core/-ingest/-store/-render` in
  `crates/<short-name>/` directories; the binary package is `look-above` (crates/app).
- **Workspace resolver 3**, shared `version`/`edition`/`rust-version`/`license` via
  `[workspace.package]`. Dependency pins deferred to item 0.2 as planned.
